<font size =+2>In an increasingly visually dense world, where our eyes are constantly distracted, sometimes it’s easier to listen an article on the go than to sit and read. Now you can convert docx and pdf files to mp3s!</font>
 
Play and load converted docs as you would any other mp3 file. 

To use this script, all you have to do is:

<b>1.</b> From terminal, execute: python doc2mp3.py </br>
<b>2.</b> Enter the name of the the docx or pdf text file when prompted to do so </br>
<b>3.</b> <i>Voilà!</i> An message will appear saying the mp3 has been created file

Depending on document size, the mp3 may take a few minutes before it is playable.
